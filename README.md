# Capstone Project 
## Perceived Value and Pricing of Apparel: A Predictive Analysis

This project explores the factors that most influence the perceived value of apparel items. The goal is to develop a predictive model that helps brands adjust pricing strategies to maximize perceived value while retaining customer loyalty. The analysis focuses on identifying key features, such as materials, brand reputation, and competitor pricing, that drive perceived value

## Problem Statement
Pricing apparel effectively is a challenge for brands due to the subjective nature of perceived value. Overpricing risks losing customers, while underpricing may diminish perceived quality. This project aims to build a data-driven solution to predict apparel prices based on features that align with customer expectations.
### Dataset 
The dataset for this project includes information on apparel items sourced from multiple fashion e-commerce platforms. Key attributes include:

- Brand: The apparel's brand name.
- Materials: Composition of the apparel (e.g., cotton, polyester).
- Category: Type of apparel (e.g., shirts, dresses).
- Customer Ratings: Average ratings given by customers.
- Competitor Prices: Prices of similar items in the market.
- Price: Target variable (actual price of the apparel item).

### Results
*Model Performance*
- RÂ² Score: 0.9959
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 14,610.64
